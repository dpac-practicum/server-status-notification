# End of the day

## Prompt

Write a script that emails you and Sky when it's 10 minutes before your shift ends. You can use whatever scripting languages you prefer. This script should be able to run (or be executed) indefinitely so as to notify us every work day (but not the weekend!)

## Submitting

So far, you have been submitting tasks by adding your changes directly to the `master` branch. The `master` branch however is typically reserved for code that can immediately be deployed into production. This time, you will be uploading this assignment using Github Flow, a popular workflow supporting collaboration and regular deployments.

The submission process will look like this:
1. You make changes on a new branch.
2. You make a pull request (PR) from that branch to the `master` branch.
3. We will discuss how you did, give pointers, and ask questions on that PR page
4. If changes are requested, you can make changes to the same branch and they will be added to the PR.
5. Once everything is complete, I will merge the branch to master and you'll be done!

Here is a more detailed explanation on [how to submit](https://github.com/dpac-practicum/Submitting#submitting-tasks) your code.  
Here is more information about [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) if you're interested.
