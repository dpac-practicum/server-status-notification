# Server status notifications

## Prompt

If a business-critical service goes down, it is not enough to just log its status. It will often be important to also notify a system admin. With that in mind, write a script that pings a server hourly and if it is down, have it send an email to Sky.

## Submitting

So far, you have been submitting tasks by adding your changes directly to the `master` branch. The `master` branch however is typically reserved for code that can immediately be deployed into production. This time, you will be uploading this assignment using Github Flow, a popular workflow supporting collaboration and regular deployments.

The submission process will look like this:
1. You make changes on a new branch.
2. You make a pull request (PR) from that branch to the `master` branch.
3. We will discuss how you did, give pointers, and ask questions on that PR page
4. If changes are requested, you can make changes to the same branch and they will be added to the PR.
5. Once everything is complete, I will merge the branch to master and you'll be done!

Here is a more detailed explanation on [how to submit](https://github.com/dpac-practicum/Submitting#submitting-tasks) your code.
